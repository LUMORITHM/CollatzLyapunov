def alpha(n_mod_16: int) -> float:
    """
    Returns the modular penalty Î±(n mod 16) as defined in the paper.

    The penalty values are predetermined based on the residue of n modulo 16.

    Parameters:
        n_mod_16 (int): The residue of n modulo 16. Must be in the range [0, 15].

    Returns:
        float: Penalty value associated with the residue.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n_mod_16 is not an integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive).
