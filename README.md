# CollatzLyapunov

This project explores a Lyapunov-inspired function designed to study descent in Collatz-Syracuse trajectories. It includes:
- Î± modular penalty calibration
- growth-streak heuristics
- empirical validation
- SAT-solver encoding for formal verification

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
